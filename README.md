# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter dataset analysis 

### Purpose
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to find trends based on Launch date and Goal
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Campaigns were sorted based on the launch date. Success is most evident in the summer months.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns were sorted based on the size of goal. Success is higher when the goal is low.
## Results

* When looking at the Outcomes based on Launch Date, the kickstarter campaigns launched in the summer months, especially June, had the best rate of success. Meanwhile, the kickstarter campaigns launch in the winter months had the lowest rate of success

* When looking at the Outcomes based on Goals, success was almost directly proportional to the amount of the goal. Higher goals will less likely to succeed. However, in campains with goals between $3000 and $4000, the opposit was found to be the case: the campaigns became more successful in this range.

* The dataset provided a substantial and encompassing view of Kickstarter campaigns. It did not suffer from any pertinent limitations that i felt would limit the outcomes.

* Visualizations that could be added in order to provide more insight include: Outcomes based on campaign length and outcomes based on backer count.
